  "description": "G1 is used to position the tool at a specific feed rate. The speed (feedrate) can be set with F*feedrate* and E *amount* amount of material can be extruded during the move. The firmware coordinates moves so that the feed rate for each axis and extruder is consistent and predictable. S can be used to check for endstops (S0: check, S1: ignore) but may not be implemented by your firmware.",
